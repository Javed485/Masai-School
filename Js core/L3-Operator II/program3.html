    <h2>You are given five numbers, stored in the variables with the following name<br>
        one, two, three, four, five<br>
        You have to declare another variablesum1, such thatsum1 = one + two + three<br>
        Also, you have to declare another variablesum2, such thatsum2 = four + five<br>
        Finally, you have to print the output of the following operation<br>
        sum1 > sum2 (This operation prints true, if sum1 is greater than sum2, else it prints false)</h2>
