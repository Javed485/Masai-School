    <h1>You are given a numbernumstored in a variable with the name num<br>
        You have to find the sum of firstnumnatural numbers in the range of1 to num, including the value stored in num itself, but each number should be added twice<br>
        For example, consider the value stored in num = 3, therefore, the sum of first num natural numbers is sum = 1 + 2 + 3, but each number has to be added twice<br>
        Therefore,sum = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 12, which is the required answer
    </h1>
    <script>
        let num = 3;
        let sum = 0;
        for(let i=1; i<=num; i++){
            sum = sum + i + i;
        }
        console.log(sum);
