        According to the definition, the factorial ofnumwill be5*4*3*2*1 = 120, which is the required answer.<br>
        Note: Factorial of 0 is 1.

    <script>
        let num = 5;
        let factorial = 1;
        for(let i=num; i>0; i--){
            factorial = factorial * i;
        }
        console.log(factorial);
