    <h1>You are given a string, stored in a variable with the namestr. The size of the string is stored in a variable N. The string contains only small case English alphabets. You have to print True, if more than half the characters in the strings are vowels, else print False.
    For example, consider the value stored in N = 6, and str = "aabefe". The number of vowels in the string are 4, which is more than half of the length of the string, which is N/2 = 3. Therefore, the required output is True    
    Note : The value stored in N, will always be even.
