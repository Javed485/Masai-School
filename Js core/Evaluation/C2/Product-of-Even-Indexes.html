    <h1>You are given an array, whose size is stored in a variable with the name N
        The array is stored in a variable with the name arr
        You have to find the product of all the elements of the array, which are stored at even indexes
        For example, consider the value stored in N = 4, and the value stored in arr = [1,2,3,4]. 
        Then, the elements stored at even indexes are1,3, therefore, the product becomes1*3 = 3, which is the required answer.
        Note : Indexing in the array starts from 0
    </h1>

        let n = 4;
        let arr = [1,2,3,4];
        let product = 1;
        for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
            if(i%2==0){
                product = product * arr[i];
            }
        }
        console.log(product);
