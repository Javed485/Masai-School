    <h1>You are given an array of strings, whose size is stored in a variable with the name N.
        The string array, is stored in a variable with the name arr.
        You have to find how many of the strings stored in the array arr, are weak, and how many of them are strong.
        A string is considered as strong if it contains at least one of the following characters in it@,$,#,*.
        Consider the example, in which the value stored inN = 4, and the array,arr = ["test123", "new@t", "mon*y", "nrupul"].
        The first string "test123", does not contain any of the required characters, hence the string is weak.
        The second string "new@t", contains the character `@`, hence the string is strong.
        The third string "mon*y", contains the character `*`, hence the string is strong.
        The fourth string "nrupul", does not contain any of the required characters, hence the string is weak.
        Therefore, the required output becomes weak strong strong weak.
