    <h1>You are given an array, stored in a variable with the size arr.
        The size of the array is stored in a variable with the name n.
        You have to find the count of 0's ,1's and 2's.
        For example, consider the array asarr = [0 1 0 2 1 2 0 1 2 0], and the value stored in n = 10.
        Then, the required output will be 4 3 3, as no. of 0's are 4, no. of 1's are 3, and no. of 2's are 3.
    </h1>
    <script>
        let n = 10;
        let arr =[0,1,0,1,1,1,0,2,2,0];
        let count1 = 0;
        let count2 = 0;
        let count3 = 0;
        for(let i=0; i<n; i++){
            if(arr[i]==0){
                count1++;
            }else if(arr[i]==1){
                count2++;
            }else if(arr[i]==2){
                count3++;
            }
        } 
        console.log(count1,count2,count3);
