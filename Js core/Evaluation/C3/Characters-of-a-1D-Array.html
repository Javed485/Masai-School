    <h1>You are given a string, whose size is stored in a variable with the name N.
        The string is stored in a variable with the name N.
        Each element of the string contains one of these symbols -'*', '-', '/'.
        The symbols represent the following values.
        * -> 0
        - -> 1
        / -> 2
        You have to generate a string, such that each symbol is replaced by its corresponding values.
        For example, consider the value stored inN = 5, and the value stored instr = */-*/.
        Therefore, replacing each value with it's corresponding value, we get02102, which is the required answer.

        let n = 5;
        let str = '*/-*/';
        let bag = '';
        for(let i=0; i<n; i++){
            if(str[i]=="*"){
                bag += 0;
            }if(str[i]=="-"){
                bag += 1;
            }if(str[i]=="/"){
                bag += 2;
            }
        }
        console.log(bag);
