    <h1>Electricity consumption is measured via slab rates for a particular wattage capacity, which is as follows<br>
        Apart from the slab rates, a fixed charge of Rs. 80 is also added to every bill.<br>
        You are given total amount of bill, N , you need to find total unit consumed.<br>
        0-50 = 3Rs.<br>
        51-150 = 5Rs.<br>
        151-above = 10Rs.
